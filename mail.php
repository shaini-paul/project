Its been 2 weeks since I re-started working with you.

I have given you some WP Plugin related  work that you was working from last 15-20 days 
with Manish Sir for a Plugin enhancement feature.

I have discuses with you for the features and the task you needs to do, and have done possible support.

First few days I found that you were struggling to understand the code, 
and only added few code for adding one feature but that also not 
fully completed.

While working with you I also found that You also having problem in understanding 
what code is actually doing, and only have guess that code is doing something.

The major Problem I found that you are lacking :

- Failed to do basic If/else logic in code, and struggling what do be done.

- You failed to decide what feature I should use and how that will 
be useful.

- You need longer time to complete that task.

- Lacking in testing for various possible cases.

The problem is not with WordPress code, but the problem is CORE PHP/MYSQL logics. 
So I found that you have less capability to do some logic programmings.


In past when I given few projects to you, that were also delayed, but so 
far you had enough time to learn her week points, and should have improved.

As far as I remember We have given her basic trainings for HTML/CSS too.


So you need a through understand of work/task, and need them to be completed on time.
I can see that you now learning things that should have done quicker.


Please do a focus on this note.
